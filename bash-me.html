<h1> Hi my name is Sam Herwig </h1> 
</header> 

<h2> I am a Creative Technoloy & Design Masters student at CU Boulder. </h2> 
<h3> I am somewhat new to web development as I attempted to take my web credit abroad in London where I was too busy being in vlogs with my youtubing thai roommate. </h3> 
<h3> I am from Breckenridge and my favorite thing to do is ski, but my mom blessed me with the knee genetics of a flamingo so I have torn both ACL's but that hasn't stopped me from skiing the rocks and bumbs that is Colorado this year </h3> 
<h3> I am doing my masters thesis on computer graphics in THREE.js so am especially interested in the cool weird side of web development.

<h2> I want to learn all kinds of Web Development from this class but specifically enough to be able to get a job. I have heard a lot of good of things about node.js and I am really excited to learn new techniques in CSS because I am just terrible at it. </h2>
